Project Overview
Efficient traffic management is essential in urban areas to minimize congestion, save energy, and improve road safety. This project implements a fuzzy logic system to dynamically control traffic light durations at a two-road intersection based on real-time traffic density.

The system uses:

Inputs: Traffic density on two roads (categorized as low, medium, or high).
Output: Duration of the green light for each road (categorized as short, medium, or long).
Fuzzy Rules: Logical conditions that determine the green light duration based on traffic density combinations.
Key Features
Adaptive Traffic Management: Dynamically adjusts traffic light durations based on varying traffic conditions.
Scalability: Can be extended to multi-road intersections with additional fuzzy rules and inputs.
Simplicity: Fuzzy logic provides a straightforward yet robust way to handle complex traffic scenarios.


How It Works
Traffic Density Inputs:
Road 1 and Road 2 are analyzed for traffic density (low, medium, high).
Fuzzy Rules:
Green light duration is determined using fuzzy rules, e.g., if Road 1 is high and Road 2 is low, Road 1 gets a long green light.
Output:
Duration of the green light for each road (short, medium, or long).
